            <h1>Heartland Pizza Co.</h1>

            <p>As an individual who has a body that is built by pizza, anytime I have the opportunity to try a new pizza
                place, I’m excited to dive in. Heartland Pizza Co. opened in 2017 and hasn't looked back since.
                Heartland Pizza Co. offers a nice, unique menu which will have something for anyone.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>The location Heartland is in, is somewhat tucked behind Oneida Street. If you’re not from the area, you
                may not see it from a main street, but if you utilize GPS, you should be able to find it no problem. One
                nice part, if you're coming to Green Bay for a Packers game, it's pretty close to Lambeau. You won't
                have to journey far to get some damn good pizza.</p>


            <p>What I really liked about Heartland Pizza is the major focus on natural products. Darin, the owner,
                walked us through the menu and explained their concept. One thing that I really like about Heartland is
                their emphasis on real food. What I mean by that is they focus on handcrafting their food. Dough is made
                in house daily, fresh veggies, premium meats and cheeses. They don't even offer soft drinks like
                Coca-Cola or Pepsi due to the corn syrups used, instead they have premium sodas that use cane sugar. It
                was great quality without a huge hit to the wallet.</p>

                    alt="Heartland Pizza Co's breaksticks with sauce." />
            </figure>

            <p>Since my initial visit to Heartland I've rewrote this review a couple of times and even increased the
                score. Every time I go to Heartland Pizza Co. I question why I don't go there more often. The freshness,
                great staff, and amazing product makes Heartland Pizza Co. a winner every time.</p>

            <p>Darin and his team are continously adding delicious items to their menu. Recently they decided to start
                offering fresh pasta that is made in house. If you're looking for a great place to eat, that is also
                close to Lambeau Field, this is the spot for you. Go visit Darin and his team at Heartland Pizza Co and
                get yourself a great meal.</p>
