            <h1>Not By Bread Alone</h1>

            <p>Not By Bread Alone is located just off of Oneida Street in Green Bay Wisconsin, which makes it close to
                Lambeau Field and convenient for those coming to a game. Not By Bread Alone is known for their fresh
                bread, sandwiches, soups, and desserts.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>The first thing you notice when you go into Not By Bread Alone is the aroma. The mixture of fresh bread
                with desserts makes for a very welcoming entrance. They offer a great mix of hot or cold sandwiches, as
                well as a nice selection of salads.</p>

            <p>When it comes to their food, the quality never disappoints. To me, what really makes the sandwich I get
                is the bread. The sandwich I get is served on a high quality multi-grain bread. Their sandwiches seem to
                balance all ingredients perfectly. Some places seem to add way too much lettuce or other ingredients
                that takes away from the rest of the sandwich, but not at Not By Bread Alone. Honestly, when you get
                something to eat from Not By Bread Alone, the thing that always seems to stands out is the quality. From
                the bread all the way down to the sauces on the sandwiches, it's all of the highest quality.</p>


            <p>Honestly, Not By Bread Alone is turning into my go-to spot when I'm looking to grab a great, quality
                sandwich. If you're looking to grab a quick sandwich, loaf of bread, or some great desserts, I'd highly
                recommend checking out Not By Bread Alone.</p>
