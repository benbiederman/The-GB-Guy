            <h1>CityDeck</h1>

            <p>One of my favorite free places to go in Green Bay is the CityDeck. It's a beautifully maintained area to
                relax and enjoy the evening by the water. There's even a water sprinkler area where kids can run through
                the water jets. Honestly, it's just a nice place to relax at the end of long day while enjoying a
                beautiful sunset.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>A beautifully designed area, where you can go and relax and enjoy the day. There are a few bars located
                on the water, so you can enjoy their outdoor patio while you throw back a few cold ones. <a
                    href="../locals-guide/hagemeister-park.html">Hagemeister Park</a> has one of the nicer patio areas
                on the CityDeck. They even have fires for those chilly fall evenings.</p>

            <p>One area to call out, their website lists hours as being Monday - Sunday 06:30am to 10:00pm. I can say
                that I've been down there much later than 10:00pm without issue. The area seems open to walk at any
                hour, I did list the hours below based on what their website says, but felt I should make it known here
                that these are maybe suggested hours.</p>

            <p>Whether you're just relaxing, drinking, walking, or doing some fishing, the CityDeck is a cool place to
                check out. It's a nice place to explore the scenery and visit some local shops. One of my favorite
                features of the CityDeck is that it's free. That's an especially nice feature if you're traveling from
                out of town since everything can get so expensive.</p>
