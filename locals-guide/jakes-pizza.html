            <h1>Jake's Pizza</h1>

            <p>Another pizza place to review? Yes, please! For this round I stopped by Jake's Pizza to see what they're
                all about. Serving up the za for over 40 years, Jake's Pizza has become a staple in the Green Bay
                community. I wanted to see if the hype was real, anytime pizza is involved, I'm eager to dive in.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Walking into Jake's Pizza is a cool experience. They have a unique vibe at their restaurant. You feel
                like you're walking into a building that has history and character. Their ceilings and walls are lines
                with metal tiles that really create a great visual experience, with plenty to look at.</p>


            <p>If you're looking to go in and get a quick pizza, it may not be the spot for you. Per their menu, if you
                order the 14 inch pizza, the expected cook time is 45 minutes, as their nights get busier, I'm sure
                it'll take longer to flip your order. Also, their hours may vary slightly. Depending how slow their
                night is going, they may shut off their ovens 45 minutes or so before the closing time.</p>

            <p>When it comes to the pizza, the crust style was different (in a good way). It's almost like a pan style
                crust, but thin crust at the same time. It's hard to explain, but I haven't had anything like it before.
                The big downside to the pizza, for me, was the sauce. We ordered their cheesy breadsticks with the
                traditional pizza sauce. When we dove in on the sauce, we noticed it had a distinct taste that we
                initially couldn't figure out what it was. After a few rounds of tasting, we realized that it tasted
                like chili. I'm not sure if they put chili powder in their pizza sauce, but it really threw me off that
                every bite tasted like chili. I like chili, but not chili flavored pizza.</p>

            </figure>


            <p>Overall, it was a cool spot to check out, but I'm not sure how often I'd go back. With so many great
                pizza joints out there like <a href="../locals-guide/rustique-pizzeria.html">Rustique Pizzeria</a>, I'd
                probably elect to dine at one of those over Jake's Pizza...unless I'm craving chili pizza?</p>
