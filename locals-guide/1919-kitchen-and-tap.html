            <h1>1919 Kitchen & Tap</h1>

            <p>Located inside of beautiful Lambeau Field sits 1919 Kitchen & Tap. It's a nice change from Curly's, with
                a much more updated look and feel. Inside 1919 Kitchen & Tap you'll find a massive bar, with TVs at
                every angle. It's a perfect place to sit back, watch the game, and drink some of Wisconsin's finest
                craft beer. As far as grubbing at 1919, I'm not as sold. Their cheese curds were absolutely amazing, but
                aside from that, it wasn't anything special to me. The quality was poor from my experiences, cold
                product and long wait for food and drinks. That matched with the price you pay, it wasn't somewhere I'd
                go too often nor recommend for food.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>The first thing you'll notice is the beautiful atmosphere. Unlike Curly's Pub, 1919 Kitchen & Tap
                actually feels like
                it belongs inside <a href="lambeau-field.html">Lambeau Field</a>. The design of the restaurant fits with
                Lambeau Field's look and
                actually compliments it nicely. Inside the restaurant you'll be surrounded by TVs and even get a nice
                view of the 50 foot Lombardi trophy.</p>

            <p>1919 Kitchen & Tap has a nicely sized drink menu, with an emphasis on craft beers. The amount of beers
                they have to offer means that you'll never have to worry about running out of beer to try or going
                thirsty while enjoying watch some sports on one of their many TVs. When it comes to their food, I've
                never had much luck. The few times I've been to 1919 Kitchen & Tap, the food has came out incorrect or
                has been poor quality. Plus, given that it's a tourist attraction, the prices are a little on the higher
                side.</p>

            <p>All in all 1919 Kitchen & Tap is a beautiful restaurant, really well thought out. Their cheese curds were
                top notch and definitely a place that would be good to have a drink at. I definitely would skip getting
                dinner there though. In my opinion, there are far too many places I'd rather grab dinner from that serve
                a better product at a better price like <a href="rustique-pizzeria.html">Rustique Pizzeria</a>, or <a
                    href="copper-state-brewing.html">Copper State Brewing</a>. Also, with it being in Lambeau Field,
                odds are that it'll be insanely busy there come game day weekends.</p>
