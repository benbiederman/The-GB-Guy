            <h1>Old Mexico</h1>

            <p>Located on the outskirts of Green Bay, in Suamico, is Old Mexico. Old Mexico is an authentic Mexican
                restaurant that opened in 2019 and has quickly gained popularity due to their authentic food and fresh
                products used. I've heard a lot of great things about Old Mexico, I was very excited to give it a try.
            </p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>The first thing I noticed as I walked into the restaurant was the atmosphere. The bar to the left when
                you enter has Mexican currency into the bar, along with a lot of other touches that give off a cool
                vibe. At the reception desk they had boxes of avocados from Mexico for sale; authentic from the start.
            </p>

            <p>Old Mexico has quite a big menu, offering a lot of different dishes. I decided to be extra boring and get
                some enchiladas. Shortly after placing our order, a cart pulled up to the table. The man with the cart
                goes to each table and makes guacamole fresh, for each table. I've never seen that done before. It was a
                nice touch, and something that really made their freshness stand out to me.</p>


            <p>The turnaround time on our food was unreal. It felt like by the time we poured some salsa into the dish
                and ate a couple of their fresh chips, our food was out. The food was fantastic, best enchiladas I've
                ever had. The red sauce was made in house, and had more flavor than I've ever had from another red sauce
                at any other restaurant.</p>

            <p>Old Mexico has so much going for it, it's no wonder why it's gained so much popularity over the past
                seven months they've been open. I'm looking forward to going back. I think if you were to try a Mexican
                restaurant in Green Bay, you wouldn't be disappointed by Old Mexico.</p>
