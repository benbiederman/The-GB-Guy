            <h1>Graystone Ale House</h1>

            <p>Graystone Ale House is a bar/restaurant located in beautiful De Pere, Wisconsin. Established in 2010,
                Graystone has been serving the De Pere area a wide-variety of food options for nearly a decade. I
                decided to see what Graystone Ale House was all about.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>We ended up getting there relatively early on a Friday, despite getting there early, it was already quite
                busy. We immediately got seated at our table and were greeted by a very friendly waitress. She was
                definitely the highlight of the venture. Good hospitality isn’t always the easiest to find and she
                knocked it out.</p>

            <p>One thing I found out about Graystone Ale House is that they’re owned by the same people associated with
                <a href="../locals-guide/the-bar.html">The Bar</a> and <a
                    href="../locals-guide/hagemeister-park.html">Haegemeister Park</a>; which I’m
                undecided how I feel about that. I had a very bad experience at <a
                    href="../locals-guide/hagemeister-park.html">Haegemeister Park</a>, however, I always thought <a
                    href="../locals-guide/the-bar.html">The Bar</a> was decent. Graystone Ale House, to me, was a very
                forgettable place.
            </p>

            <p>For my dinner, I ordered a cheeseburger and tater tots (because I’m a 7 year old). The first thing I
                noticed was the small quantity of tater tots you get. Someone online even called out the minimum amount
                of tots, I received. Napoleon Dynamite would not be hyped about it. I bet you didn’t expect a reference
                from a 2004 movie in a food review did you?! The burger was decent, but as I said before, the entire
                meal was quite forgettable. In fact, if not for my notes I jotted down, I’d struggle with this review
                since I’m doing it a few days after eating there.</p>

            <p>One thing that may appeal to individuals coming to Green Bay during a Packers game is that Graystone
                offers a shuttle to Lambeau Field. That’s a nice little perk. I’m not sure how many places in the area
                offer that, but it’s always good to have the options.</p>

            <p>Overall, I’d eat at Graystone again, it wasn’t bad. However, I don’t see myself going there again anytime
                soon because there are so many other options in the area I’d rather go to instead.</p>
