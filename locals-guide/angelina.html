            <h1>Angelina</h1>

            <p>If you're looking for an amazing meal in Green Bay, look no further than Angelina. Angelina is known for
                their authentic Italian dishes that will absolutely blow you away. The founder of Angelina was born and
                raised in Italy, after moving here in 1993 she was surprised to see what Americans considered Italian
                food. Her love of a kitchen and cooking made her decide to start Angelina. I'm grateful she did.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>The first thing you should expect when dining at Angelina is a wait. It's a popular spot in Green Bay,
                especially on Fridays and Saturdays. If you're looking to beat the wait, you can make a reservation
                through their <a href="https://www.angelinagb.com/" target="_blank">website</a>. I'd highly recommend
                doing this if you're looking to guarantee your spot at
                Angelina.</p>

            <p>When it comes to their food, the size of their dishes are deceiving. When I first received my order I
                thought I'd still be hungry at the finish. The fresh pasta, which is made in house, left
                us too full to enjoy any dessert. The freshness and flavor of the ravioli in the bolognese meat sauce
                was like something I've never had in an Italian dish. Compared to my experience at Grazies Italian Grill
                (which has since closed), this was a night and day difference. I had to fight back the urge of licking
                the bowl clean. I figured that was probably frowned upon in such a nice restaurant.</p>

            <p>As stated above, if you're looking for a really great place to go for dinner, this is one that's on the
                top of the list for me. You won't regret this decision. I'm looking forward to going back again.</p>
