            <h1>Titletown District</h1>

            <p>The Green Bay Packers recently built one of the coolest additions to complement a stadium in the history
                of the NFL. Located next to beautiful Lambeau Field is the Titletown District. The Titletown District is
                a wonderful place where you can go to attempt to show yourself ‘you still got it’ by playing football
                against teenagers, only to leave feeling bad about yourself after being schooled in football by kids
                half your age (that was my first experience with the Titletown District haha). Along with destroying
                your self-esteem, the Titletown District offers a wide variety of budget friendly things to do with the
                whole family.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Honestly, I think the Titletown District is one of the best additions to the area in quite a while. It
                offers so much to people who come to the area without really breaking the bank. There’s a snow hill, ice
                skating rink, playground, football field, 40-yard dash, and other events/games you can play. While most
                of what Titletown District offers is free, you do have to pay to do certain things there. The prices for
                tubing range anywhere from $3 – 12 per person depending on if you want to do it once or all day, and
                which day you go. Ice skating can vary between $2 – 9 per person, once again depending on which day you
                go, with rentals being available at a small price. They do offer family and group packages as well,
                which can help on the budget.</p>

            <p>What I really like about this addition is the bonds it’ll create with kids in the community. The amount
                of friendships that will be created due to the pickup games of football at their full-sized field will
                be really awesome. I honestly can’t think of anything negative about the Titletown District, I love what
                they did with the space and the benefits it offers to the community. You have to check this one out when
                you’re in town.</p>
