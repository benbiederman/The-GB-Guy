            <h1>Aldo's Pizza</h1>

            <div class="content-overview">
                <p>Located inside of beautiful Lambeau Field sits 1919 Kitchen & Tap. It's a nice change from Curly's,
                    with a much more updated look and feel. Inside 1919 Kitchen & Tap you'll find a massive bar, with
                    TVs at every angle. It's a perfect place to sit back, watch the game, and drink some of Wisconsin's
                    finest craft beer. As far as grubbing at 1919, I'm not as sold. Their cheese curds were absolutely
                    amazing, but aside from that, it wasn't anything special to me. The quality was poor from my
                    experiences, cold product and long wait for food and drinks. That matched with the price you pay, it
                    wasn't somewhere I'd go too often nor recommend for food.</p>

                <h3>What to expect:</h3>
                <p>The first thing you'll notice is the beautiful atmosphere. Unlike Curly's Pub, 1919 actually feels
                    like it belongs inside <a href="../locals-guide/lambeau-field.html">Lambeau Field</a>. The design of
                    the restaurant fits with Lambeau Field's look and actually compliments it nicely. Inside the
                    restaurant you'll be surrounded by TVs and even get a nice view of the 50 foot Lombardi trophy.</p>

                <p>1919 Kitchen & Tap has a nicely sized drink menu, with an emphasis on craft beers. The amount of
                    beers they have to offer means that you'll never have to worry about running out of beer to try or
                    going thirsty while enjoying watch some sports on one of their many TVs. When it comes to their
                    food, I've never had much luck. The few times I've been to 1919 Kitchen & Tap, the food has came out
                    incorrect or has been poor quality. Plus, given that it's a tourist attraction, the prices are a
                    little on the higher side.</p>

                <p>All in all 1919 Kitchen & Tap is a beautiful restaurant, really well thought out. Their cheese curds
                    were top notch and definitely a place that would be good to have a drink at. I definitely would skip
                    getting dinner there though. In my opinion, there are far too many places I'd rather grab dinner
                    from that serve a better product at a better price like <a href="rustique-pizzeria.html">Rustique
                        Pizzeria</a> or <a href="copper-state-brewing.html">Copper State Brewing</a>.
                    Also, with it being in Lambeau Field, odds are that it'll be insanely busy there come game day
                    weekends.</p>
