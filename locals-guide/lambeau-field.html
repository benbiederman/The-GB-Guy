            <h1>Lambeau Field</h1>

            <p>One must thing to do when coming to Green Bay is to go to Lambeau Field, and not just for game day.
                Unlike a lot of professional sports stadiums, Lambeau Field is open to the public 363 days a year.
                Lambeau Field offers something for anyone and everyone who is coming to the city to visit.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Listen. It’s probably not necessary to have Lambeau Field listed on this website. I’d imagine a majority
                of people who are visiting my website, looking for things to do in Green Bay, are already planning on
                being at Lambeau Field in some capacity. I do want to have it in my local’s guide though, so anyone
                coming to Green Bay knows what Lambeau Field has to offer.</p>

            <p>Outside of enjoying a Packers game, one of the best things Lambeau Field offers is a stadium tour.
                Stadium tours come in many different tiers. Certain tours, like the alumni tour, are only offered
                certain times of the year. Other tours are offered any day Lambeau Field is open. Depending on the tier
                of tour you do, depends on how much you are able to see. However, regardless of what tier you select,
                you are going to have an incredible experience. Each guide is so well versed with Packers knowledge,
                that you can take the tour numerous times and learn something new each time. If time and your budget
                permit, I’d highly encourage you to take a tour. You won’t regret it.</p>

            <p>Another experience that tends to be just as enjoyable as the Packers stadium tour is the Packers Hall of
                Fame located inside of Lambeau Field. The Packers Hall of Fame offers over 100 years and 13
                championships worth of history. The Packers Hall of Fame is a great way to spend hours at Lambeau Field,
                while simultaneously learning more about such a historic franchise.</p>

            <p>If you are planning on exploring the hall of fame or stadium tour while in Green Bay for a Packers game,
                I’d highly implore you purchase those tickets online, ahead of time. Stadium tours can sell out, so I’d
                hate for you to arrive at Lambeau Field, eager to do a tour and not have a chance to do it. Another
                thing to note, if you’re planning on doing both the stadium tour and the hall of fame, you can buy both
                in a package deal to save yourself some money. You can find more information about the Packers HOF and
                stadium tours <a href="https://www.packershofandtours.com/" target=”_blank”>here</a>.</p>

            <p>If shopping is more your thing, Lambeau Field has you covered there as well. In the bottom floor of
                Lambeau Field is a massive pro shop. The Packers Pro Shop offers anything and everything you could
                imagine in Packers theme. Along with all their awesome Packers merchandise, they also have a lot of
                Lambeau Field merchandise as well. It makes it a great place to pick up some souvenirs for yourself or
                others.</p>

            <p>After all the exploring and shopping you do at Lambeau Field, you may find yourself in search of some
                appetizers, a meal, or some drinks. Lambeau Field has you covered there as well. Inside of Lambeau Field
                is 1919 Kitchen & Tap. 1919 Kitchen & Tap is an absolutely stunning restaurant. You can find my review
                of 1919 Kitchen & Tap in my local’s guide, or by clicking <a
                    href="../locals-guide/1919-kitchen-and-tap.html">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Finally, if you’re looking to enjoy Lambeau Field but not spend an arm and a leg, Lambeau Field is a
                great place to go and just explore. It’s a beautiful place to walk around and just enjoy the atmosphere.
                You can Lambeau Leap in front of the Packers Pro Shop, view the statues of Curly and Vince, or continue
                your walk across the street to the Titletown District</p>

            <p>One last call out, Lambeau Field is cashless as of 2020. If you're going to Lambeau Field, be sure that
                you have your card with you to make purchases.</p>
