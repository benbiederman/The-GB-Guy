            <h1>Basil's II</h1>

            <p>Get those extra napkins ready, for this review we went to Basil's II. Basil's II is a bar/restaurant
                located in Denmark, WI. Known for their butter burgers and great prices, Basil's II offers a vast menu
                that will offer something for anyone.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>The first thing I want to call out - if you're planning on going to Basil's II, just know it's located
                slightly outside of Green Bay. I believe it's roughly 15 miles outside of Green Bay. It's mostly
                backroads to get there, but well worth it. Some small town bars really make you feel alienated from the
                moment you step in but not Basil's II. The bartender really helped explain to us how their process works
                without making us feel stupid.</p>

            <p>Speaking of process, at Basil's II if you're looking to eat, you would go to the bar to get menus. Once
                you know what you're going to eat, you place your order with the bartenders. After placing your order
                they assign you a table. It's a little different type of process but it seems to work well for them.</p>

            <p>When it comes to their food, you get definitely get bang for your buck. We ordered a cheeseburger, double
                bacon cheeseburger, perch sandwich, french fries, potato wedges, and cheesecurds. Our total for all of
                that food was $26. The portion sizes didn't lack for that price point either, it was more than enough
                for the three of us. The food itself was great. I know places like <a href="krolls-west.html">Krolls</a>
                and <a href="drift-inn.html">Drift Inn</a> get talked
                about a lot for their butter burgers, but I'd personally go to Basil's II over both of those locations.
            </p>

            <p>If you're looking for a nice ride to grab some great food, look no further than Basil's II. This is one
                of those hole in the wall places that I always enjoy finding. I do want to address my photo I used, it's
                not a pretty photo. The burger was a messy one. Please don't let my poor photo determine if you're going
                to this spot. The burger was damn good and I can't wait to go back.</p>
