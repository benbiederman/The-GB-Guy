            <h1>Brickhouse Craft Burgers & Brews</h1>

            <p>Burgers and craft beer, what's not to like? Brickhouse Craft Burgers and Brews offers an extensive list
                of craft beers to compliment their burger list. Their beer list consists an abundance of local beer, so
                you'll never run out of beer while enjoying a burger. It's a great environment for a night out with
                friends or a fun first date. They have some games in their upstairs area that overlooks the restaurant.
                To be completely honest, I wasn't in awe over the burger I had. It was decent, and I'd get one again,
                but it wouldn't be my go-to place for a burger. I'd gladly go back to watch a game and have some
                cheesecurds though.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>One unique feature that I personally loved about Brickhouse Burgers is that they gave us a dish of
                pickles. They offer three different types of pickles, so no limiting which ones you get to try on your
                burger. I didn't ask, but I'm pretty sure they're homemade pickles, which shows how much Brickhouse
                Craft Burgers and Brews cares about their quality.</p>

            <p>A nice variety of appetizers. We went with the deep fried cheesecurds because we're true Wisconsinites.
                They were light and fluffy, not heavily breaded, but I felt they were missing that crunch. Definitely
                worth trying, with their homemade sauces they provide with the curds.</p>

            <p>As stated above, the burger didn't blow me away. I would gladly go back to try another burger. The vibe
                of the restaurant makes it an inviting place to go grab a burger and a beer, if you're into those
                things.</p>
