            <h1>Cozumel</h1>

            <p>Located off of Oneida Street in Green Bay, Wisconsin is Cozumel. Cozumel is a Mexican restaurant that is
                a new restaurant to the area, as of me writing this in January of 2020. While Green Bay isn't short of
                Mexican restaurants, great Mexican food is always good to have. I was excited to see how Cozumel ranked
                compared to the other Mexican restaurants in Green Bay.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Upon entering the location, the first thing you notice is that Cozumel invested a lot of time and money
                into their location. The inside is very beautifully done, very inviting. We were immediately greeted by
                the hostess and brought to our table.</p>

            <p>I kept it simple for my order by ordering cheese enchiladas... Let's be honest, with my palate being
                equivalent to a seven-year-olds, I always keep my order simple. Shortly after ordering we were given
                chips and salsa that were made fresh in house, no store-bought chips for this joint.</p>

            <p>The turnaround time was quick for our food and despite us customizing our orders slightly, there were no
                issues or errors. I'm going to be honest with you, their enchilada sauce was probably the best enchilada
                sauce I've ever had. It was very fresh and complimented the dish really nicely. I'm by no means an
                enchilada sauce connoisseur, but damn, that was great stuff.</p>

            <p>Cozumel seems to be doing all the right things in their restaurant. I'm eager to go back again and see
                what other amazing dishes they have to offer. Maybe next time I'll try and leave room for dessert as
                well.</p>
