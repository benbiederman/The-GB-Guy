            <h1>Sgambati's Pizza</h1>

            <p>Located in beautiful De Pere Wisconsin is Sgambati's New York Pizza. While their specialty may be New
                York pizza, they offer a wide variety of options on their menu, ranging from burgers to seafood to
                salads. There is something for everyone at Sgambati's. I was excited to dive in and try their pizza.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Sgambati's is one joint in town that if you didn't live here or weren't from the area, you probably
                wouldn't know it exists and you definitely wouldn't know how to spell the name (I had to reference back
                to Google many times to remember). It's somewhat tucked away from main streets. In fact, I lived fairly
                close to it for years and didn't know about it for a couple years of living here.</p>

            <p>During this visit I ordered my favorite pizza - a buffalo chicken pizza. Anytime someone offers that as a
                menu item, they automatically get a thumbs up from me. One thing I noticed immediately when I started
                eating my pizza was that their cheese blend was very unique and stood out in a positive way. I browsed
                their website after eating, they even mention their cheese blend on their website:</p>

            <p><i>We use fresh dough, sauce and other ingredients made daily on location, not to mention a special
                    cheese blend from the "Big Apple".</i></p>

            <p>One thing that I really liked about Sgambati's is the fact that they sell pizza by the slice in their
                location in case you're just needing to grab a slice to go or want to try a few different types of
                pizza.</p>

            <p>Overall, I really enjoyed my Sgambati's experience. New York style pizza is my favorite kind. This
                definitely won't be my last time going to Sgambati's New York Pizza.</p>
