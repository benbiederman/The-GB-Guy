            <h1>Narrow Bridge</h1>

            <p>Located in the Howard area (don't let the Green Bay address fool you) is Narrow Bridge Brewhouse. Narrow
                Bridge Brewhouse is a newish restaurant in the area, opening early 2019. Offering a wide-variety of food
                options, Narrow Bridge Brewhouse has something to eat for anyone.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>The first thing I noticed when I arrived at the location is how much work they're doing to make the
                restaurant their own. They were in the process of adding a patio area in the front of the restaurant, as
                well as getting the inside decorated and put together. The former restaurant that was at this location
                was a little more dated and had a much different demographic. It was great to see Narrow Bridge trying
                to make their interior more updated. It now is giving off the vibe of a sports bar, some place you'd
                watch the game while eating a burger and drinking a brew.</p>


            <p>When it comes to the food, the burger was really enjoyable; the flavor was great, and was seasoned
                nicely. The item that pleasantly surprised me, however, were the fries. When you order a menu item that
                comes with fries, it's not just normal fries, it's a trio of fries. Your order of fries will include
                normal fries, swirl fries, and waffle fries - all mixed together. It's such a small thing, but it really
                stood out to me. It was nice having the variety of fries while eating instead of having to choose one or
                the other. Is it weird that I was that hyped over fries? Maybe... Probably.</p>

            <p>Overall, my visit to Narrow Bridge Brewhouse was a positive one. There were some areas they'll need to
                improve upon, however, more of those are due to the fact that they're such a new restaurant. I'd gladly
                eat at Narrow Bridge again</p>
