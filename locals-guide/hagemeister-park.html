            <h1>Hagemeister Park</h1>

            <p>Hagemeister Park was the home of the Green Bay Packers during their first two seasons in the National
                Football League. So how does a restaurant named after one of the most historic sites in Green Bay score
                when it comes to food? To me, Hagemeister Park is just meh. In my opinion, given the vibe of the
                restaurant you'd think it'd be a better finished product.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Located in beautiful downtown Green Bay, along the Fox River and on the <a
                    href="../locals-guide/citydeck.html">CityDeck</a> is Hagemeister Park. Hagemeister Park has a menu
                that caters to a wide audience. To compliment their restaurant, they have a couple bars, one located
                inside and the other located out back along the <a href="../locals-guide/citydeck.html">CityDeck</a>.
                The outdoor bar is absolutely beautiful, in fact, I ranked Hagemeister Park slightly higher due to that
                bar. It's beautiful to sit out there on a Summer night and enjoy the atmosphere.</p>

            <p>The food on the other hand... not the greatest. When dining at Hagemeister Park for dinner. We almost
                ordered a menu item but after the waiter confirmed it had onions in it, we ordered something else. Once
                we got our dish, we started eating only to realize that our dish had onions in it. We asked the waiter
                about the onions, he stated that it normally doesn't have it but the cooks decided to add them. Then
                instead of correcting it or offering an alternative dish to eat, he just said he could take a little bit
                of money off our bill, despite the only things we ordered being the dishes they messed up by putting
                onions in. Other experiences at Hagemeister havn't been as bad, but this one left a bad taste in my
                mouth... much like those onions. If it's up to me, I'd rather go to <a href="black-sheep.html">Black
                    Sheep Pub & Grill</a> or <a href="copper-state-brewing.html">Copper
                    State Brewing</a> for dinner and then walk down to Hagemeister Park for some drinks out by the
                water.</p>
