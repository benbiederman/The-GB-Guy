            <h1>Legend Larry's</h1>

            <p>If you're a big wing person like I am, you have to check out Legend Larry's. In my opinion, Legend
                Larry's is the best wing joint in Green Bay. Their award winning traditional wings are nicely sized and
                go well with their signature Legend Larry's sauces. Pair that with the fact that Legend Larry's is also
                a bar, and you have a great combination. You can drink and eat wings all night. If that's not a great
                time, I don't know what is.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>When you sit down, you won't be greeted by wait staff, they don't have any. On each table there are some
                order forms and menus. Once you fill out your order, you'll bring it up to the bar. When you're ordering
                they'll also ask what you want to drink, if you haven't already ordered a drink. If during your meal you
                need anything, you'll once again go up to the bar.</p>


            <p>Another good thing to call out about Legend Larry's is their menu is pretty limited. Aside from wings,
                they sell battered shrimp and appetizers. Personally, if you're going to Legend Larry's, go for their
                award winning wings. Let's be honest, if you go to Legend Larry's and don't get their wings, you're
                truly missing out in your life.</p>

            <p>Listen, I LOVE Legend Larry's, but I still have some criticism for them. My biggest complaint about
                Legend Larry's is their operation during sporting events. With their current set up, whatever is playing
                on the jukebox will override the rest of the audio. So, if you're watching a game or other event there,
                and someone decides they want to hear Cher's entire collection of work, you will listen to that instead
                of the event that is playing. I learned this the hard way when an NFL draft was interrupted by 80's one
                hit wonders. It resulted in us having to leave Legend Larry's to watch the draft elsewhere.</p>
