            <h1>Packers Heritage Trail</h1>

            <p>It’s no surprise to anyone who has ever heard about the Packers has also heard about their history. The
                history and heritage of the Green Bay Packers is one of the differentiating factors compared to other
                NFL franchises. One of the more underrated Packers thing to do while in Green Bay is to take the
                heritage trail. The Packers Heritage Trail is a nice tour that takes you to numerous places where
                history happened. The best part of it all, it’s free!</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>This tour can take you a little bit of time to go through, depending on what you all decide you'd like to
                see. Part of the trail is a 3 mile walk, which takes you in a bunch of different parts of downtown Green
                Bay. Some of the other places may require you to drive around for them. If you’re fan of history like I
                am, you’ll enjoy this tour. You get to see historical sites like Curly’s birth place home, his grave
                site, and Lombardi’s family home.</p>

            <p>If you're planning on doing the Heritage Trail, you can check out the Heritage Trail Map and scout the
                places you're wanting to check out. If you're in from out of town without the means to drive around the
                city, the Packers offer trolley tours as well. You are able to <a
                    href="https://www.packershofandtours.com/explore/heritage-trail/trolley-tour"
                    target="_blank">purchase</a> these before you come on your trip, this way you know you have them
                prior to coming to Green Bay.</p>

            <p>Another nice part about doing this trail, you’ll get to walk along the <a
                    href="../locals-guide/citydeck.html">CityDeck</a> which is a really nice addition to the downtown
                Green Bay area. It’s a beautiful area to be at during a nice day. Along the
                way, you can stop at <a href="../locals-guide/copper-state-brewing.html">Copper State Brewing</a> for a
                cold one or some cheese curds during this walk. It’s a no brainer.</p>
