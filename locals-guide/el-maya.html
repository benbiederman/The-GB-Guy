            <h1>El Maya</h1>

            <p>Located in the same strip as Festival Foods in De Pere is El Maya. There seems to be a lot of 'El'
                Mexican restaurants in the Green Bay area. On this review we see how El Maya compares to the others, <a
                    href="el-sarape.html">El Sarape</a>... El Presidente (RIP)... and now El Maya. Let's see where El
                Maya ranks on the list of El restaurants!</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>El Maya has recently moved into this location due to their former location being turned into a Kwik Trip.
                If that's not the most Wisconsin thing I could type, I'm not sure what is. Anyway, I stopped by to see
                their new location and how the food fared. The first thing you notice when walking in is the greatest
                statue ever made. It's a statue of a guy wearing a sombrero, smoking a cigar, rocking a handlebar
                mustache while wearing a Rodgers jersey. It's the most impressive thing you may see at any restaurant in
                Green Bay.</p>

            <p>Here's something about me. Anytime I go to a Mexican restaurant, I generally get the same thing because
                I'm a very boring individual. In case the suspense is killing you, the item I generally get is a
                burrito. I kept the trend going with El Maya. My first thought of El Maya was their prices were a little
                higher than the other El joints. One thing that jumped out to me while waiting for my food was that
                their chips aren't freshly made. It's such a minor thing to complain about, but it's something that
                stood out when comparing it to the other El joints. El Maya's burrito was fairly different than El
                Presidente or El Sarape. The meat was inside the tortilla, while everything else was around the plate or
                on top of the tortilla. I'm not sure if that's more traditional, but when I think burrito, I think of it
                all in one wrap for my lazy self to eat. The flavor on the ground hamburger for the burrito was better
                than I had expected it to be, but it felt more like a big taco than a burrito.</p>

            <p>To wrap it up, while I thought El Maya was pretty good, I don't know if I'll go back. I don't say that
                because it was terrible or anything, but if I'm doing Mexican food in Green Bay, I'm going to go to <a
                    href="el-sarape.html">El
                    Sarape</a> every time over El Maya. I prefer El Sarape's portion sizes, prices, and style more than
                El Maya.
