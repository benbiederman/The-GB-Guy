            <h1>Drift Inn</h1>

            <p>If you’re utilizing this guide as a way to find those hole-in-the-wall places in Green Bay, Drift Inn is
                exactly the spot you’re looking for. Drift Inn is one of those places that doesn’t get talked about too
                much, but you never know why. While they may have a menu that offers a wide range of items like burgers,
                fish, and cheese curds, their lore resides mostly in their chili. Around Green Bay the words Drift Inn
                and great chili are synonymous.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Before deciding to come to the Drift Inn, one thing you'll want to do is check their hours. Their hours
                change by the time of the year. During the Summer, May to end of September, they are open Monday through
                Friday 11:00am - 11:30pm. During the Winter, October to end of April, they are also open Saturday from
                11:00am - 8:30pm.</p>

            <p>When you first head into the restaurant, you'll notice a bunch of tables. Don't wait for a hostess to
                greet you and seat you, you seat yourself. You won't see a sign that says to do so, but find an empty
                table and start looking at the napkin holder. The napkin holder? Yep, that's where they have their menu
                printed. Don't worry, see below, I took a picture of it so you can come prepared. The prices may be
                different when you go, but when it comes to the food menu, I got you.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>One thing I'd recommend is coming prepared with an idea with what you'd like. Depending on the server you
                get, they can be quite impatient. They're expecting you to know what you want so they can flip the table
                quickly. Do your best to have an idea of what you're going to eat right from the start.</p>

            <p>Their food is very simple, but great. As I stated above, they're very well known for their chili.
                However, they also serve the staples of any good dive bar. I personally don't get their chili, not
                because it's not good, but because it has onions in it and I have the palate of a seven-year-old.</p>
