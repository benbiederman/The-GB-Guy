            <h1>Zesty's</h1>

            <p>Known for their butter burgers and custard, Zesty's has been serving the Green Bay area for over 30
                years. Winning Best of the Bay for best dessert in Green Bay for the past six years, Zesty's has
                established itself as a place that is a must visit when coming to town.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Before going to Zesty's, make sure the location you're heading to is open. The Riverside location is only
                open during the summer season. If you're planning on going during the fall or winter, odds are you'll
                need to go to either the Howard or Allouez location.</p>

            <p>As I stated above in the intro, Zesty's is known for their butter burgers and custard. However, they
                serve a wide variety of food options. Zesty's is one of the only places I've seen that offers Booyah,
                which if you're not familiar, is a NE Wisconsin dish. It's similar to a chicken noodle soup, but
                different. With how big of an emphasis butter burgers tend to be for people who are coming to town, I
                thought that would be a great item to try for this visit.</p>

            <p>During this trip to Zesty's, I ordered my butter burger and instead of doing fries, I wanted to try their
                cheesecurds. The first thing that stood out to me about the butter burger was that it didn't have an
                excessive amount of butter on it. I've been to other places that offer butter burgers, and put so much
                butter on them that it's a big chunk when you bite in. To me, I like butter, but don't want to just take
                a bite of a big chunk of butter... that could be just me though. The cheesecurds were really good, some
                of my favorite ones I've had lately. You're given the choice between white, yellow, or mixed curds,
                which was a nice touch for me since I prefer white cheesecurds</p>

            <p>Aside from delicious butter burgers or cheese curds, they also have some amazing custard. If you're not
                familiar, or have never had custard, I'd highly recommend giving it a try when in town. Zesty's does
                their custard perfectly. Each day they offer a unique flavor of the day option, but they also have a
                vast menu of custard dishes if you're not looking to get the flavor of the day</p>

            <p>Zesty's is a fun joint to check out. It has that throwback vibe and is something I enjoy every summer.
                You can use the trail to walk alongside the river, all the way down to Zesty's on Riverside Drive. Then
                walk the trail a little bit afterwards to help burn off those calories. There's usually a line outside
                the building due to it being a stand and not a sit down joint. If you're looking to grab some food or
                custard on the go, there is a drive-thru however. The other Zesty's locations are year round restaurants
                where you can dine in or take it on the go with you</p>
