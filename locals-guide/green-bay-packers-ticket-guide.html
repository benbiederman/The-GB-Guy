            <h1>Green Bay Packers Ticket Guide</h1>

            <p>If you're reading this, I can only assume you're wanting to go to Lambeau Field, but you're not quite
                sure how to go about getting a ticket to a Packers game. With a current waiting list of over 130,000
                people, Packers season tickets at <a href="../locals-guide/lambeau-field.html">Lambeau Field</a> are
                reserved for the elite Packers fans who come from generations of Packer fandom. Thanks to this waiting
                list and the die-hard fans that accompany it, Lambeau Field has been sold out since 1960. Every. Single.
                Game. Even during the drought of the 1970's through the 1980's, and especially since Brett Favre lead
                the team back to the promise land. Since the Favre era, we've obviously been fortunate to have Rodgers
                take over the team without missing a beat. Tickets to a Green Bay Packer game have never been more
                difficult to get, or have they?</p>

            <h2>"Can I even get tickets to a game?"</h2>

            <p>Of course. Anyone at any time can get tickets to a Green Bay Packer game, as long as you have the bank
                account to back it up. Green Bay Packers ticket prices can range drastically depending on numerous
                factors:</p>

            <p><b>Opponent:</b> Whether the Packers are playing an NFC North rival or another rival from the NFC such as
                the Cowboys, Seahawks, or Falcons, the tickets can be inflated in price due to the demand to see these
                rivals go head-to-head. Another indication that the prices may go higher is the Packers are playing a
                team that has a loyal fan base that will be traveling to the game regardless of their team's success,
                like the Steelers. These factors can increase demand to a game thus increasing price.</p>

            <p><b>Packers Record:</b> While the Packers have been sold out since 1960 despite some horrendous seasons,
                Packer tickets get significantly easier to obtain when the Packers aren't doing well for one reason or
                another. For example, in 2017 when Aaron Rodgers broke his collarbone and we had to witness the Brett
                Hundley show, season ticket holders were doing all they could to get rid of their tickets. Prior to the
                Monday Night game against the Lions, people were selling their tickets for as low as $20/each.</p>

            <p>However, on the flip side, after Super Bowl XLV the price of tickets shot up dramatically and became
                harder to find at a decent value. I went from paying $140/ticket for 40 yard line seats to paying
                $200+/ticket for endzone seats. It makes sense though, people want to go to a game where their team is
                going to win.</p>

            <p><b>Time of Year:</b> As you already probably know, Lambeau Field is not a dome, with that comes some very
                unfavorable weather games. A lot of people don't enjoy lounging in a stadium for 3-4 hours when it's 10
                below zero and snowing. When the weather starts to get really cold, say around December, depending on
                the opponent and how the season is going, tickets can become easier to score.</p>

            <p>Another factor that the time of year can play into things is if it's preseason or post season. During
                preseason, you can get usually find tickets dirt cheap. I tend to go to every preseason game for
                $25-30/ticket. I know that not everyone wants their experience to be a preseason game, but it's a way to
                go to beautiful Lambeau Field without breaking the bank too badly, especially if you have younger
                children. When it's playoff football, the weather and many other facts that tend to decrease the price
                of a ticket goes out the window. Playoff football is a different atmosphere that obviously will increase
                the demand for a ticket since it's a win or be eliminated situation.</p>

            <p><b>Time of Purchase:</b> If you’re willing to risk going all the way to Lambeau Field for a Green Bay
                Packers game without tickets, it can pay off big time. Be sure to keep an eye on prices prior to
                kickoff. The closer it gets to kickoff, the most prices will continue to drop for the game. You
                obviously run the risk of waiting too long and being left out in the cold, but this risk can pay off big
                time as season ticket holders continue to drop their prices before kickoff in hopes of selling their
                tickets.</p>

            <h2>"Where Can I buy tickets?"</h2>

            <p>When it comes to buying tickets, I usually only purchase from reputable sources. I’m sure there are some
                websites that offer tickets but if I’m not familiar with those websites, I usually avoid them to
                purchase my Green Bay Packers tickets. Here are some websites I’ve used in the past:</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.greenbayticketservice.com/" target="_blank">- Green Bay Ticket Service</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.eventusa.com/" target="_blank">- Event USA</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/" target="_blank">- Ticketmaster</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.stubhub.com/" target="_blank">- Stubhub</a></p>

            <p>As for what site is best out of all of those, I'd recommend that you price check them all. Some tickets
                may appear cheaper on one site, but could have higher fees when checking out. Do a little research on
                all of them to determine what is best for you. I know Green Bay Ticket Service doesn't have service fees
                on their tickets, which can mean big savings when you finally go to purchase the tickets in your cart.
            </p>

            <p>One thing to note, as of 2021 the Green Bay Packers no longer offer physical tickets to get into a Green
                Bay Packers game. If anyone is trying to sell you a Green Bay Packers physical ticket, do not proceed
                with this purchase. All tickets are managed through the Green Bay Packers app.</p>

            <p>There are obviously many options on how to secure your tickets to a Green Bay Packers game, I hope this
                guide helped as much as possible. Have any questions I didn’t answer? I’d love to help you as much as I
                can, feel free to shoot me an email or send me a text and I'd be happy to help answer any questions you
                have.</p>
