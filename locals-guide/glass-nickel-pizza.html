            <h1>Glass Nickel Pizza</h1>

            <p>With numerous locations throughout Wisconsin, Glass Nickel Pizza has been throwin' dough since 1997.
                Glass Nickel Pizza is proud to source many of their ingredients from local companies to not only provide
                the freshest ingredients, but also support local businesses. With all the great things mentioned, I was
                excited to give Glass Nickel Pizza a try.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>My first impression of Glass Nickel Pizza was their parking lot. It's a cramped space with limited spots
                reserved to Glass Nickel Pizza. It was a mildly irritating way to start my Glass Nickel Pizza journey.
                Walking into Glass Nickel Pizza I was greeted immediately by a friendly guy behind the bar, who was
                quick to assist in checking on my pizza. My pizza had a delay on being ready, but the bartender was
                quick to communicate about the delay. He actually ended up giving me a $10 off my next purchase due to
                the delay, which was definitely not necessary!</p>

            <p>The pizza did not disappoint. The sauce is a little different than a traditional pizza sauce, has a
                little more spice than a normal pizza sauce, which I thought was a nice touch to the pizza. The dough
                was also a little unique, they use a cornmeal to prevent sticking during their cooking process, where
                most places seem to use a flour.</p>

            <p>Parking lot mess aside, Glass Nickel Pizza is a spot I'd go back to again and not just because I have a
                free $10 towards my next meal.</p>
