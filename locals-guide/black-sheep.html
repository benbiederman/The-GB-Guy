            <h1>Black Sheep Pub & Grill</h1>

            <p>Located on the outskirts of Green Bay, out by UW GB, is Black Sheep Pub & Grill. Black Sheep Pub & Grill
                offers a nice variety of menu options to appease any individual. When browsing their menu online, there
                was an item that really caught my attention and made it a mandatory that we try this joint, more on that
                below.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Browsing online at their menu (life of a picky eater) and I see it. The couch potato burger. A
                cheeseburger with pulled pork, potato chips, AND French onion dip. I knew I had to head to Black Sheep
                Pub & Grill to give this burger a go. When we arrived at Black Sheep Pub & Grill, we were given the
                choice to sit inside or outside for our visit. Being that it's the short window of time where it's nice
                enough to actually dine outside, we elected to eat out there.</p>

            <p>They have a really nice outdoor seating area, complete with a bar outside. On this particular night they
                even had live music, which created a nice atmosphere, I'm not sure if that's an every Friday night thing
                or not. Aside from the bar and tables on their patio, they also have a fire pit and some extra seating
                if you're just looking to have a drink or five.</p>

            <p>After a brief period of waiting, I see it. My burger, in all of its glory, was heading to the table and
                let me tell you, it didn't disappoint. The ingredients they add like the chips and French onion dip are
                all homemade, which put it over the top. My only complaint about the item is that the pulled pork, which
                was great, dominated the flavor of the burger and other ingredients. Which is that's my only complaint,
                we're doing alright.</p>

            <p>Whether you're looking to get some food or just some drinks, I'd recommend Black Sheep Pub & Grill to
                anyone who is coming to the area and looking for a spot to go. I'll gladly go back myself.</p>
