            <h1>Anduzzi's</h1>

            <p>With four locations in Wisconsin, three of which in the Green Bay area, Anduzzi's has made itself into a
                staple in the area. Winning Best of the Bay as a bar in 2018, Anduzzi's has a lot to offer for those
                coming to the area.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>The first thing I noticed when I went to Anduzzi's was the abundance of seating. The parking lot was
                getting full, yet inside the place had more than enough seating. They offer an outdoor patio, which
                helped balance out the amount of people at the location.</p>

            <p>While looking at the menu, I told myself I wasn't going to do a burger for this First Try Friday. I
                generally seem to get burgers when going out, so I wanted to try something else. But then I saw it... a
                Spotted Cow Cheese Curd burger. This glorious burger was topped with bacon, spotted cow cheese sauce,
                and cheese curds. At that point, my idea to not get a burger went out the window. I had to try it.</p>

            <p>The food was quick to arrive, with a slight error - tortilla chips instead of pub chips for my
                girlfriend's order. However, the waitress was extremely quick at correcting the issue. When it comes to
                the food, both my girlfriend and I were beyond surprised at how good it was. The burger was fantastic
                and the fries were surprisingly good. We left wondering to ourselves why we had never been to Anduzzi's
                prior to that.</p>

            <p>If you're looking for a spot to have some drinks or grab some food and stick close to Lambeau Field,
                Anduzzi's would be a great choice. I'm looking forward to my next venture there.</p>
