            <h1>Luna Coffee Roasters</h1>

            <p>In my opinion, Luna Coffee Roasters is easily one of the best places to get coffee in the Green Bay area.
                The vibe of Luna Coffee Roasters, paired with the great quality coffee at a reasonable price makes Luna
                Coffee Roasters a must stop if you're in the area. Skip the Starbucks or Dunkin' and treat yourself to a
                much better cup of coffee.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Located in downtown De Pere, this gem of a place is always a buzz with people trying to get their
                caffeine fix. Despite the busyness of their business, the wait isn't bad at all. However, compared to
                those other chain coffee joints, Luna isn't built for the same type of quick turnaround those places
                offer. For example, they don't have a drive-through so if you want a cup of coffee you have to go inside
                to get it, which if that's a deal breaker for you, it's your loss.</p>

            <p>One thing I really like about Luna, aside from their coffee, is the fact that you don't break the bank
                when you go there. A lot of times with those coffee houses prices can be a little higher because you're
                paying for the experience as well as the coffee, but not with Luna. For how fresh their coffee is, you'd
                really expect to pay more. They roast their own beans on location, which brings the ultimate freshness
                to your cup of coffee. Once you go to Luna, it's hard to go anywhere else.</p>

            <p>Lastly, if you really enjoy their coffee and want to take some back home with you, they sell bags of
                their coffee on location, on their website, or as well as at some local grocery stores like Festival and
                Austin's. A portion of the proceeds from each bag of coffee sold gets donated back to local schools or
                organizations. Go get yourself some Luna, you won't be disappointed.</p>
