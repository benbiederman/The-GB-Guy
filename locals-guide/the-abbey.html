            <h1>The Abbey</h1>

            <p>Located next to St. Norbert College, and known as somewhat of a college bar, is The Abbey. The Abbey
                offers a unique atmosphere with a vast menu of food and drinks. I had heard some good things about The
                Abbey, I was excited to give it a try.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>The first thing I noticed when I walked into the Abbey was the unique environment. The walls are lined
                with items from throughout the years. They have a lot of vintage items - both local and national
                memorabilia. I had to snap a photo of it because of awesome I thought it was.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../img/locals-guide/eat/lunch/the-abbey-decoration.jpg"
                    alt="A wall filled with memorabilia at The Abbey">
            </figure>

            <p>As far as the food, it was great quality. My only gripe was the waitress didn't disclose there were
                onions in the wrap when I asked what was all on it. After getting it corrected, I was pretty pleased
                with the wrap. The crunchy chicken mixed with the buffalo and ranch, it added a nice little zip from the
                buffalo and good flavor with the ranch.</p>

            <p>One thing that was quite unique to me that I'd like to call out, when paying the bill, there are two
                different tip lines. There's a tip line for the waitstaff and one for the kitchen staff. I definitely
                wasn't prepared for that and wasn't sure what breakdown I should do for it. I've never seen anything
                like it before. I wanted to add something about it here so you can plan your attack a bit better than I
                did.</p>

            <p>All in all, The Abbey was a place I'd go again to eat. It wouldn't jump off a list of places to see in
                Green Bay for me, but it was pretty solid and left me with a good impression for the most part.</p>
