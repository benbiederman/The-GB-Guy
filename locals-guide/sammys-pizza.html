            <h1>Sammy's Pizza</h1>

            <p>Located less than a mile from Lambeau Field is Sammy's Pizza, a family owned and operated Italian
                restaurant. Sammy's Pizza is a favorite amongst those in the community. They pride themselves on
                homemade, high quality dishes with fresh ingredients. Red Batty, Packers equipment manager, always tells
                people who are waiting outside of Lambeau for autographs about Sammy's.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>The first thing I noticed was when going to Sammy's you'll have a slightly more expensive pie. A small
                pepperoni, which is pictured above, is a 10'' thin crust pizza and it cost me $14. However, given the
                quality of the food, a higher price is expected. It's a family-owned and family-operated business that
                has been creating delicious pizza and paste since the 40s. Per their website, their receipes haven't
                changed since founding the restaurant; which is evident by how good of quality of a pizza you get.</p>

            <p>Fred (<a href="https://twitter.com/Beanfm" target="_blank">@beanfm</a>) on Twitter also mentioned that
                they have a game day special at Sammy's. You pay $20 to park at Sammy's during a Packers game and in
                return get a $20 gift card to the restaurant. That is a deal you can't beat if you're planning on going
                to the game.</p>

            <p>Aside from the price, which wasn't TOO terrible, the pizza was great quality and I would gladly eat
                another pie from Sammy's.</p>
