        <h1>Coffee Wizardz</h1>

        <p>
          Relatively new to the Green Bay area, Coffee Wizardz offers some of
          the best damn coffee you will find. Sam and his team at Coffee Wizardz
          are always coming up with new drinks to showcase for different seasons
          throughout the year.
        </p>

        <h3>What to expect</h3>

        <p>
          When it comes to what you can expect from Coffee Wizardz, the first
          thing that comes to mind is some damn good coffee. Coffee Wizardz
          offers an impecible product for a great price.
        </p>

        <p>
          One thing I really like about Luna, aside from their coffee, is the
          fact that you don't break the bank when you go there. A lot of times
          with those coffee houses prices can be a little higher because you're
          paying for the experience as well as the coffee, but not with Luna.
          For how fresh their coffee is, you'd really expect to pay more. They
          roast their own beans on location, which brings the ultimate freshness
          to your cup of coffee. Once you go to Luna, it's hard to go anywhere
          else.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, if you really enjoy their coffee and want to take some back
          home with you, they sell bags of their coffee on location, on their
          website, or as well as at some local grocery stores like Festival and
          Austin's. A portion of the proceeds from each bag of coffee sold gets
          donated back to local schools or organizations. Go get yourself some
          Luna, you won't be disappointed.
