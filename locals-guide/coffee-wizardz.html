        <h1>Coffee Wizardz</h1>

        <p>
          Relatively new to the Green Bay area, opening in December 2021, is
          Coffee Wizardz. Coffee Wizardz is known for their delicious coffee and
          welcoming atmosphere. With Coffee Wizardz being so new to the area, I
          was very excited to get into their location and see what they have to
          offer.
        </p>

        <h3>What to expect</h3>

        <p>
          If you’re coming to Green Bay and looking for an amazing place to grab
          some coffee, this is the place you’re looking for. Sam and his team at
          Coffee Wizardz create a very warm, welcoming environment for anyone
          who steps foot in their store.
        </p>

        <p>
          One thing I really like about Luna, aside from their coffee, is the
          fact that you don't break the bank when you go there. A lot of times
          with those coffee houses prices can be a little higher because you're
          paying for the experience as well as the coffee, but not with Luna.
          For how fresh their coffee is, you'd really expect to pay more. They
          roast their own beans on location, which brings the ultimate freshness
          to your cup of coffee. Once you go to Luna, it's hard to go anywhere
          else.
        </p>

        <p>
          While the environment Coffee Wizardz creates is incredible, their
          coffee is even better. I’ve been to Coffee Wizardz a concerning number
          of times since it opened and I have yet to have a bad experience. In
          fact, Coffee Wizardz products are some of the best I’ve ever had.
          Coffee Wizardz has effectively ruined lattes for me at other coffee
          places in the area. I don’t know what the secret is for making such an
          incredible espresso drink, but Coffee Wizardz has it.
        </p>

        <h4>
          A few things to call out if you’re planning on going to Coffee Wizardz
        </h4>

        <p>
          Their menu is quite limited. They have a standing menu of items that
          are always offered, then they have seasonal drinks. While this may
          seem like a flaw, personally I really like this. I’d much rather have
          a consistent, high-quality product over a more customizable product
          that is meh.
        </p>

        <p>
          The portion sizes for some drinks at Coffee Wizardz are a bit more on
          the modest size. You won’t find 30oz iced drinks like you would at a
          chain coffee joint. Once again, I’m in the camp that I’d rather have a
          smaller amount of something incredible than a large amount of
          something that is meh.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of the beverages are only offered if you’re planning on enjoying
          it at Coffee Wizardz. From my experience, this only occurs for some of
          their seasonal drinks. The reason for this is because they serve it
          differently than the rest of their products and want to ensure that
          it’s being served for maximum quality.
        </p>

        <p>
          I cannot recommend Coffee Wizardz enough to anyone who loves coffee.
          Life is too short to only be drinking from chain coffee joints. Go
          experience the magic that Coffee Wizardz offers (pun definitely
          intended). After writing this, I think I’m going to need some Coffee
          Wizardz myself.
