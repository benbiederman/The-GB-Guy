            <h1>Bay Beach</h1>

            <p>Are you looking for a family friendly option in Green Bay? Those darn kids are always so expensive that
                you can’t afford to do anything, well thankfully, Bay Beach could be a perfect spot for you. With
                tickets for rides costing 25 cents each, you and your family can spend a couple hours at Bay Beach
                without you having to sell your organs to afford the amusement park.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Bay Beach is located along the bay (shocker, I know, given the name), with this being said, not only do
                you have an amusement park but you have a beautiful scenery to go with it. Another nice perk about
                hitting up Bay Beach with the family is that you’re located right next to the Wildlife Sanctuary, which
                is another great thing to do with the family.</p>

            <p>The fact that the park doesn’t break the bank is a nice perk, however, it’s not the biggest selling
                point. You can wow your kids or grandchildren by taking them on the roller coaster that was reportedly
                the favorite ride of Elvis – The Zippin Pippin. Odds are your kids won’t know who Elvis is or why it
                matters, but that doesn't matter! Bay Beach is seasonal, so be sure to check their calendar to make sure
                they're open before heading that way.</p>
