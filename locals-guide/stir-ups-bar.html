            <h1>Stir-Ups Bar</h1>

            <p>Are you feeling like busting a move while jamming out to some country music and having a few drinks? If
                so, Stir-Ups could be the bar for you. Located in Downtown Green Bay, Stir-Ups is a local hot spot for
                people (mostly college aged) who are looking to have a few adult drinks and bust a move. If you’re not
                college aged but still want to go get jiggy with it, don’t be discouraged, Stir-Ups doesn't discriminate
                on that dance floor. You’ll see people of all ages there.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>Here’s the honest truth. You may not get much out of this review. The reason being, I don’t really like
                loud bars and I definitely don’t like country music. This bar is everything I don’t enjoy. With that
                being said, it generally seems to have a good vibe for those who are getting their dance on. Their staff
                does a good job of making sure it’s a good atmosphere for those who are trying to have a good time. A
                local dance legend I interviewed, who happens to be my roommate, enjoys himself some Stir-Ups; so I
                asked him for their overall rating. Per the local dance legend, Wade, it’s a good joint to go to if you
                want to bust out your favorite dance moves. The drinks can be a bit on the pricier side. The vibe can be
                killed at times due to their odd song selection, but if you’re just there to have some drinks and
                casually dance, you probably wouldn’t care. Also, he added, “YEEHAW!”t.</p>
