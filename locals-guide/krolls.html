            <h1>Kroll's</h1>

            <p>Kroll's is one of those joints that just a staple in the area. Kroll's West is Conveniently located next
                to Lambeau Field, this restaurant is well known for their butter burgers and cheese curds. They're such
                cheese curd pros, they even let you choose between white, yellow, or a mix for which type of cheese
                curds you want.
            </p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>You can feel like you you stepped back in time when you walk into Kroll's. It has that old school diner
                feel, with round booths and fast wait staff. One big thing to mention, there's a button to press if you
                need service. A lot of people miss it or think it's for decoration, if you need something be sure to
                push it.</p>

            <p>What I really enjoy about Kroll's is their atmosphere. They have vintage Packer items displayed and a
                wall of cards signed by celebrities. It's awesome to look around after your meal and see the history of
                Kroll's.</p>

            <p>If I'm being honest, while I enjoy Kroll's burgers and cheese curds, I wouldn't really recommend someone
                to go there for their trip to Green Bay unless you go to Green Bay often. Since Kroll's West is located
                next to Lambeau Field, it's naturally a tourist attraction. It'll be very busy during game time, which
                can cause quality and turn time to slip drastically. Their burgers are decent, but very thin for the
                price you're paying. If I'm wanting a butter burger I'll go to Basil's II or Drift Inn. Kroll's is worth
                trying once for sure, but there are so many great places for food in Green Bay, you have to pick and
                choose carefully. If it were me, I'd go there just for an order of cheese curds.</p>
