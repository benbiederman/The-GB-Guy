            <h1>Daily Buzz Espresso Bar</h1>

            <p>The Daily Buzz Espresso Bar is located in a beautiful corner business of a building in downtown Green
                Bay. Known for their drinks involving espresso, Daily Buzz Espresso Bar isn't just limited to espresso
                beverages. They also serve coffees, teas, and smoothies along with their delicious espresso drinks to
                make sure they offer something for any person.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>The location Daily Buzz Espresso Bar is located in, is an absolutely beautiful location with a lot of
                natural light. It’s a very cool location if you were wanting to grab a coffee and do a little bit of
                work, or just relax and enjoy the atmosphere. The only draw to the location is that parking can tend to
                be limited where it is located, so you may have to walk a bit more to get to Daily Buzz Espresso Bar.
                Also, if you go to Daily Buzz Espresso Bar on a Saturday in the Summer months, you’ll have to navigate
                the Farmer’s Market to get to it. It’s not a huge deal if you know about it up front, but something to
                call out.</p>

            <p>Similar to <a href="../locals-guide/luna-coffee-roasters.html">Luna Coffee Roasters</a>, if you’re in a
                big rush you may want to go elsewhere to grab a cup of deliciousness. They don’t offer a drive-thru for
                their guests, so it can be more of a timely process to get in and get your drink. I wouldn’t let that
                discourage you from trying Daily Buzz Espresso Bar, while it can be a bit of a wait, I’ve never had an
                experience where it’s an outrageous wait time. I will also tell you that the wait has always been worth
                it in my experiences</p>

            <p>My biggest complaint with Daily Buzz Espresso Bar is that they can run of certain ingredients for their
                popular drinks quite often. An example of this is they tend to always be out of the horchata for their
                horchata latte. While it’s not a huge deal since they serve up a lot of different, delicious drinks,
                just something that can make it annoying when you have your heart set on one drink in particular.</p>

            <p>All in all, Daily Buzz Espresso bar serves up some absolutely delicious drinks. They offer a variety of
                seasonal beverages too to keep their menu fresh and interesting. I’d definitely encourage anyone to give
                them a try if they’re looking for a great place to grab a cup of their daily buzz.</p>
