            <h1>El Sarape</h1>

            <p>Are you ready to drink a margarita the size of a small fish bowl? What about eat a burrito the size of a
                brick? El Sarape could be the place you’re looking for. Located down the road from Lambeau Field is El
                Sarape, a favorite Mexican restaurant for many Packer players. It’s apparent from the moment you walk in
                the door. One of their benches (Packered themed of course) is signed by Packers players throughout the
                years.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>I’m just going to start out by saying that I’m not a huge fan of Mexican food. I’m too picky of an eater
                and struggle to find things that don’t contain onions. However, with that being said, I really enjoy El
                Sarape. Here’s what I love about these types of Mexican restaurants, which I’m sure everyone agrees with
                me, the complimentary chips and salsa. While I don’t eat the salsa (damn picky eaters), the chips are
                always great. To make it even better, El Sarape makes their chips fresh, in house. During this visit at
                El Sarape, I ordered a burrito with their steak. I was pleasantly surprised at the portion size I
                received given the price tag. I feel like my burrito had more steak in it than it did rice, which I
                didn’t expect one bit. I’ll definitely go back there to right this wrong, but was really happy with my
                El Sarape experience. I may become a Mexican restaurant fan, yet.</p>

            <p>While looking at the menu, I told myself I wasn't going to do a burger for this First Try Friday. I
                generally seem to get burgers when going out, so I wanted to try something else. But then I saw it... a
                Spotted Cow Cheese Curd burger. This glorious burger was topped with bacon, spotted cow cheese sauce,
                and cheese curds. At that point, my idea to not get a burger went out the window. I had to try it.</p>

            <p>Since writing my first review on El Sarape I've visited their restaurant numerous times. Each time I go,
                I'm unable to finish my food due to the sheer volume of the portions. El Sarape is the best Mexican
                restaurant in the area, in my opinion. If you're looking for a Mexican spot to try, do yourself a favor
                and give El Sarape a go.</p>
