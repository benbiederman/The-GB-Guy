            <h1>The Pancake Place</h1>

            <p>If you're looking for some place in Green Bay to knock yourself into a food coma for under $10/person,
                you may as well stop reading now and head to The Pancake Place located on Military Ave, only a few miles
                from Lambeau Field. The Pancake Place is one of my favorite breakfast joints in town. I'm not alone in
                thinking this either, in fact, The Pancake Place has won Best in the Bay for breakfast too many times to
                count.</p>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>

            <p>When you arrive, it's not uncommon to see people waiting outside for their table since the lobby is too
                full. Don't let this deter you too much, they're quick to flip tables and usually you'll have your spot
                in 15-20 minutes. If you have a party of six or more, you can make a reservation ahead of time to avoid
                the wait. Another thing to
                expect when you head to The Pancake Place is insane portion sizes. When I go, I generally order a half
                portion size of the stuffed hashbrowns, which I can only usually eat half of the half portion! I'm not
                quite sure how they manage to stay in business with the portion sizes you receive for what they charge
                you.</p>

            <p>If you're looking for a great spot to get breakfast, look no further than The Pancake Place. You get a
                massive amount of food, with great service, for a great value.</p>
